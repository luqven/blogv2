## Welcome

Hey, I'm Luis 👋🏼. I help build developer tools for the web, most recently as an SDK Engineer at [@imgix](https:www.imgix.com), based out of San Diego.

## About me

I'm Software Engineer active in open source community, helping maintain over 20 open source [libraries](https://github.com/luqven). I speak and write about getting the best performance out of videos and images on the web.

I grew up in Venezuela 🇻🇪, but I've lived in the states most of my adult life. Most recently, I moved to the ~~West~~ Best Coast, where I've grown to tolerate avocado toasts and acai bowls.
